## 🧠 GPT-5 Meta-Prompting Guide

To maximize the effectiveness of these prompts with GPT-5 and other advanced models, incorporate these meta-prompting tags into your workflow.

### Meta-Prompting Tags Explained

#### `<persistence>`

**Purpose**: Ensures the AI agent completes the entire task autonomously without premature termination.

**Key Behaviors**:

- Continue working until the user's query is completely resolved
- Only terminate when the problem is definitively solved
- Never stop when encountering uncertainty—research or deduce the most reasonable approach
- Don't ask for confirmation or clarification—make informed assumptions and document them
- Act as an autonomous agent, not a conversational assistant

**Example**:

```xml
<persistence>
- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved
- Never stop when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue
- Do not ask the human to confirm or clarify assumptions — decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for the user's reference after you finish acting
</persistence>
```

---

#### `<exploration>`

**Purpose**: Guides thorough investigation and planning before implementation.

**Key Behaviors**:

- Never guess—always use tools to read files and gather information
- Decompose requests into explicit requirements, unclear areas, and hidden assumptions
- Map the scope: identify relevant codebase regions, files, functions, or libraries
- Check dependencies: frameworks, APIs, config files, data formats, versioning
- Resolve ambiguity proactively based on repo context and conventions
- Define the output contract: exact deliverables, expected outputs, tests passing
- Formulate an execution plan with research steps and testing strategy

**Example**:

```xml
<exploration>
If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure, use your tools to read files and gather information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.
Before coding, always:
- Decompose the request into explicit requirements, unclear areas, and hidden assumptions
- Map the scope: identify the codebase regions, files, functions, or libraries likely involved
- Check dependencies: frameworks, APIs, config files, data formats, versioning
- Resolve ambiguity proactively based on repo context and conventions
- Define the output contract: exact deliverables, tests passing, etc.
- Formulate an execution plan with research and testing strategy
</exploration>
```

---

#### `<tool_preambles>`

**Purpose**: Structures AI communication for clarity and transparency.

**Key Behaviors**:

- Begin by rephrasing the user's goal in friendly, clear, concise language
- Immediately outline a structured plan detailing each logical step
- Narrate each step succinctly and sequentially during execution
- Mark progress clearly as you work through tasks
- Finish by summarizing completed work distinctly from the upfront plan

**Example**:

```xml
<tool_preambles>
- Always begin by rephrasing the user's goal in a friendly, clear, and concise manner
- Then, immediately outline a structured plan detailing each logical step
- As you execute, narrate each step succinctly and sequentially, marking progress clearly
- Finish by summarizing completed work distinctly from your upfront plan
</tool_preambles>
```

---

#### `<self_reflection>`

**Purpose**: Ensures the AI produces world-class, thoroughly evaluated outputs.

**Key Behaviors**:

- Create an internal quality rubric with 5-7 categories
- Think deeply about what makes an excellent solution
- Use the rubric to evaluate and iterate on the solution internally
- If not hitting top marks across all categories, start again and improve
- Don't show the rubric to users—it's for internal quality control

**Example**:

```xml
<self_reflection>
- First, spend time thinking of a rubric until you are confident
- Create a rubric with 5-7 categories for evaluating solution quality
- Think deeply about every aspect of what makes for a world-class solution
- Use the rubric to internally iterate on the best possible solution
- If your response is not hitting top marks across all categories, start again
</self_reflection>
```

---

#### `<reasoning_effort>`

**Purpose**: Controls how deeply the model thinks and analyzes before responding.

**Key Behaviors**:

- Scale reasoning effort based on task difficulty
- Use **low** for simple, straightforward tasks
- Use **medium** (default) for moderate complexity
- Use **high** for complex, multi-step tasks requiring deep analysis
- Higher reasoning improves output quality for complex problems
- Break separable tasks across multiple turns for peak performance

**Reasoning Effort Levels**:

- **Low**: Quick responses, simple tasks, well-defined problems
- **Medium**: Balanced thinking for moderate complexity
- **High**: Deep analysis, multi-step reasoning, complex problem-solving

**When to Use High Reasoning**:

- Code reviews requiring security and architecture analysis
- Complex refactoring decisions
- Multi-file impact analysis
- Performance optimization requiring algorithmic changes
- System design and architecture decisions

**Example**:

```xml
<reasoning_effort>
For this code review task requiring security analysis, architecture evaluation, and cross-file impact assessment, use HIGH reasoning effort to ensure comprehensive analysis across all dimensions.
</reasoning_effort>
```

---

#### `<code_editing_rules>`

**Purpose**: Establishes comprehensive standards for code quality, structure, and user experience.

**Key Behaviors**:

- Follow guiding principles for clarity, reusability, and consistency
- Adhere to specified technology stack defaults
- Apply UI/UX best practices throughout implementation
- Maintain high visual quality standards

**Subsections Explained**:

**`<guiding_principles>`** - Core development philosophy:

- **Clarity and Reuse**: Every component and page should be modular and reusable. Avoid duplication by factoring repeated UI patterns into components
- **Consistency**: The user interface must adhere to a consistent design system—color tokens, typography, spacing, and components must be unified
- **Simplicity**: Favor small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity in styling or logic
- **Demo-Oriented**: The structure should allow for quick prototyping, showcasing features like streaming, multi-turn conversations, and tool integrations
- **Visual Quality**: Follow high visual quality standards (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.)

**`<frontend_stack_defaults>`** - Standard technology choices:

- **Framework**: Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Lucide
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Directory Structure**: Standardized organization with `/app`, `/components`, `/hooks`, `/lib`, `/stores`, `/types`, `/styles`

**`<ui_ux_best_practices>`** - User experience guidelines:

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Limit typography to 4–5 font sizes and weights for consistent hierarchy; use `text-xs` for captions and annotations; avoid `text-xl` unless for hero or major headings
- **Color Usage**: Use 1 neutral base (e.g., `zinc`) and up to 2 accent colors for visual consistency
- **Spacing and Layout**: Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm. Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling when handling long content streams
- **State Handling**: Use skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` to indicate data fetching. Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`)
- **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate. Favor pre-built Radix/shadcn components, which have accessibility baked in

**Example**:

```xml
<code_editing_rules>
   <guiding_principles>

- Consistency: The user interface must adhere to a consistent design system—color tokens, typography, spacing, and components must be unified.
- Simplicity: Favor small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity in styling or logic.
- Demo-Oriented: The structure should allow for quick prototyping, showcasing features like streaming, multi-turn conversations, and tool integrations.
- Visual Quality: Follow the high visual quality bar as outlined in OSS guidelines (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.)
   </guiding_principles>
   <frontend_stack_defaults>
- Framework: Next.js (TypeScript)
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- Icons: Lucide
- State Management: Zustand

     /(pages)                      # Page routes
   /components/                    # UI building blocks
   /hooks/                         # Reusable React hooks
   /lib/                           # Utilities (fetchers, helpers)
   /stores/                        # Zustand stores
   /types/                         # Shared TypeScript types
   /styles/                        # Tailwind config
   </frontend_stack_defaults>
   <ui_ux_best_practices>
- Visual Hierarchy: Limit typography to 4–5 font sizes and weights for consistent hierarchy; use `text-xs` for captions and annotations; avoid `text-xl` unless for hero or major headings.
- Color Usage: Use 1 neutral base (e.g., `zinc`) and up to 2 accent colors.

   </ui_ux_best_practices>
</code_editing_rules>
```

---

#### `<context_understanding>`

**Purpose**: Ensures comprehensive context gathering before action.

**Key Behaviors**:

- If an edit may partially fulfill the query but you're not confident, gather more information
- Bias towards not asking the user for help if you can find the answer yourself
- Use available tools to understand the full context before making changes
- Verify assumptions through exploration rather than guessing

**Example**:

```xml
<context_understanding>
If you've performed an edit that may partially fulfill the user's query, but you're not confident, gather more information or use more tools before ending your turn.
Bias towards not asking the user for help if you can find the answer yourself.
</context_understanding>
```
